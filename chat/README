A node backend for the project.

============================

We're using:
    o Node.js - evented I/O for JS. Provides event loop as a
                "language construct" with callback-based programming
                http://nodejs.org/

    o Redis - A key/value or "data structure" server. Fast, in-memory data
              sharing and background-writing persistence.
              http://redis.io

    o Socket.IO - server and client side socket networking, cross-browser and
                  very simple. Uses websockets if available, or flash if available,
                  or ajax if available.
                  http://socket.io

    o Structr - Provide a simple class system for javascript. Looks clean and
                can provide more advanced functionality if needed, like overloading,
                properties, etc.
                https://github.com/spiceapps/Structr

    o JSDoc - using jsdoc style for commenting and documentation. Following
              google javascript style guide
              see http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml
              and http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/
              and https://github.com/micmath/jsdoc

    o Express/Jade - express is a node web framework, jade is a templating engine.
